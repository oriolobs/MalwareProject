 Project about Rubber Ducky Attack

In real use case scenarios ethical hackers may be called to test closed network environments. The closed network
environments have a private network which cannot be accessible from outside. In these cases, some ways
to attack such an environment is either to have an insider or to use a device with combination of the human
behavior exploitation. In the first scenario, the attacker should send a person that she knows, with the required
skills for the attack, to be hired by the target company. In the second scenario, the attacker will use a person
who works in the company, find the human vulnerabilities and exploit them. Consequently, the attacker will
persuade this person to use a malicious device. Attacks through pre-programmable devices, such as USBs, are
called Human Interface Device (HID) Attack.

In this project we are going to simulate the second aforementioned scenario. We attack a company called
SilliconOil dedicated to the oil industry with Internet perimeter protection. Since they have very advanced
protection mechanisms, we cannot attack from the outside. We assume that the only option to access the
company’s resources is through the workers who have physical access internally to the corporate computers
and at the same time to the internal resources. In order to do that, we need to develop a device like the rubber
ducky. USB Rubber ducky is an HID device that looks like a USB Pen drive. The most important characteristic of
USB Rubber ducky is that it cannot be detected by any Anti-Virus or Firewall as it acts as an HID device. In more
detail, the computers don’t automatically run programs from flash drivers because of their built-in safety. The
system detects the rubber ducky as a slave device, keyboard, mouse, etc. and not as a malicious device. USB
rubber ducky acts as a keyboard and has keystrokes installed in it that run automatically when someone plugs
in the USB. The system follows the commands of the USB as it considers it as a keyboard, a trusted part.

The goal of the simulated attack is to disrupt business continuity by encrypting important files. The resilience
of these companies is crucial. Furthermore, one of our main aims of this attack is to damage the company’s
reputation. To achieve this we will steal sensitive data and we will publish it. Finally, this attack also aims to
install a backdoor for a later attack.

The implementation of our USB includes the following techniques: Backdoor, ransomware and obfuscation,
change server settings to route the worker in a malicious website. To achieve the execution of the attack we use
Social Engineering.
So, the steps to follow are:
1. Achieve that a worker uses the self-executing USB.
2. Download the obfuscated payloads from a server.
3. 1st payload: Install a reverse shell, backdoor.
4. 2nd payload: Store important files in a FTP server and encrypt the files.
5. DNS poisoner: change server settings to route the worker in a malicious Linkedin site, combining the
phishing email technique. So, the attacker will be able to steal account data (username and password).
